# Lecture 1 Summary

1. We chatted about FRC software structurally, namely the functionality of the integral parts of the system (VScode, WPIlib, CTRE client, REV client, Roborio Imager, Radio configuration, Driver station, etc.). Make sure you know whatâ€™s the purpose of each
2. Next, we moved on to the wiring. How every device is connected in detail, including (Roborio, Power Distribution Panel, Pneumatics Hub, Radio, pressure switch, compressor, etc.). Also, what different wire lines are used (power, data line, and networking line)
3. We dived into the details of the different communication protocols used to share messages among devices. Especially, for PWM and CAN, what they are, how they work, and what pros and cons.
4. Jumping out from that, we discussed gameplay strategies in a logical map. We took an example of the 2018 game and developed objectives we need to achieve software-wise and constructed a logic map that will be later coded.
5. In the end, we briefly talked about state machine design, which is a formal way of laying out all software logic in an illustrative way. Crucial to aid software development.
