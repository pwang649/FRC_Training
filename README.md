## Course Description

Disclaimer: This course is not a Java 101 class.

Half of the course covers the mathematical, theoretical, and physical foundations of robotics systems and principles of software development. Topics include logic flow, control, vision, etc. The other half of the course is more practical. We will go through codes from previous seasons and implement code for the current season from scratch. We will use the theories and methods taught in the class on code implementation.


## Prerequisite

This class is for two different types of audiences: the ones who have fairly weak math and physics fundamentals but are motivated to learn and the ones who have strong physics and math foundations. It’s recommended that students come equipped with some essential knowledge (trigonometry, physics, and basic programming) and demonstrate mastery over them (getting A’s in those classes). For those who don’t, motivation must be present in order to succeed in this class.


## Course Outline



1. General info
2. How software works with hardware
3. Auto + Teleop strategies (How to write code for each)
4. Code walkthrough
5. Testing, safety, and distributed system (mainly Github)
6. Control 101
7. Advanced control
8. Vision 101
9. Advanced vision
10. Advanced Autonomous
11. Special Topics
12. Three series of code implementation


## Grading policy:



* Class participation + note taking: 50%
* Homework (Coding + Problem-solving work): 30%
* Project (contribution to robot code): 20%


## Grading scale:



* [93, 100] = A
* [90, 93) = A-
* [87, 90) = B+
* [83, 87) = B
* [80, 83) = B-
* [0, 80) = F


## Class Participation

Attending the real-time zoom meeting is highly suggested. Research has shown that performance in class is strongly related to class attendance. In case of an emergency that one can’t attend, the lecture recording is required to be watched. There will be 2 free absences, and grades will be deducted on a case-by-case basis when exceeding that threshold.


## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly and strictly abide by the materials taught in the corresponding lecture. They will be graded by completion rather than performance, namely either 100% or 0%. Each homework assignment weighs equally.

Homework collaboration is encouraged, but mindless copying is discouraged and will be penalized. Please list the names of your group members in your homework.


## Project

The project can be done in two ways.



1. Direct contribution to the robot’s code. The contribution will be evaluated by Mr. O’Shea.
2. Code a personal project, such as a miniature robotics arm, an autonomous RC car, etc. (must be relevant to topics covered in the course).
